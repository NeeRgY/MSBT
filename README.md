<br>

A maintained fork of **Mik's Scrolling Battle Text (MSBT)**, originally by **Mikord**.

Rebuilds the options window on a flat KeyHerald-style theme, with a dedicated TOC and code tree per game version.

**Current version:** `v1.0.0`

# About This Fork

This repository is maintained by **NeRgY**.

Lineage:

1. [Mikord/MikScrollingBattleText](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mikscrollingbattletext) — original MSBT
2. **NeRgY** — rebuilt the options UI and continues maintenance for Classic

Goals of this fork:

- One addon covering **Classic Era, TBC Classic, MoP Classic and Classic ("Forever")**
- One TOC and one code tree per version so nothing cross-contaminates
- A modern, flat KeyHerald-style options window instead of the old parchment UI
- Stay practical: stable, testable changes

> This is **NOT** the official MSBT repository.

# Supported Clients

| Client | Interface | TOC |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Classic Era (`1.15.9`) | `11509` | `MikScrollingBattleText_Vanilla.toc` |
| TBC Classic (`2.5.6`) | `20506` | `MikScrollingBattleText_TBC.toc` |
| MoP Classic (`5.5.4`) | `50504` | `MikScrollingBattleText_Mists.toc` |
| Classic "Forever" (`1.60.1`) | `16001` | `MikScrollingBattleText_Mainline.toc`\* |

`Libs/`, `Fonts/`, `Sounds/`, `Artwork/` and the core `Localization/` folder are shared by all four TOCs. SavedVariables stay `MSBTProfiles_SavedVars` / `MSBT_SavedMedia`, so existing MSBT settings carry over.

\* The "Forever" client reports `WOW_PROJECT_ID` as `WOW_PROJECT_MAINLINE`, so WoW's automatic flavor detection only ever looks for a `_Mainline`-suffixed (or unsuffixed) TOC - a `_Forever` suffix is never considered, no matter its `## Interface` value. The file is still named `_Mainline` for that reason alone; it loads the `Forever/` code tree (Classic-style API and content), not Retail.

## NeRgY Fork Highlights

- Options window rebuilt on a flat, KeyHerald-style theme (panel, nav rail, accent color) instead of the old parchment/paperdoll UI
- New **Settings** tab: custom HSV color picker, UI language override, minimap button toggle, window scale and transparency sliders
- Minimap button to open the options window, with its own icon in the Blizzard AddOns list
- Profile export/import as a plain string, with a font preview button
- Live search across every options tab
- Themed dropdown/listbox scrollbar and tooltips to match the rest of the window
- Per-version TOC + fully separated code tree (`TBC/`, `Vanilla/`, `Mists/`, `Forever/`)
- Dead Retail-only combat log taint-avoidance code removed - every supported flavor is Classic, which never needed it

# Installation

Download the latest release, then copy the `MikScrollingBattleText` folder into:

- Classic Era: `World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\MikScrollingBattleText`
- TBC Classic / MoP Classic: `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns\MikScrollingBattleText` (Blizzard reuses this same folder for whichever Classic progression realm is currently active - the addon auto-selects the matching TOC either way)
- Classic "Forever": `World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\Interface\AddOns\MikScrollingBattleText`

Then `/reload` in-game. Options: `/msbt`.

## Important

Do **NOT** download `Source code (zip)` / `Source code (tar.gz)` from GitHub tags.
